My name is Sepideh Abedini. 
I am a master's student at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of **[Prof. M. Tamer Özsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/)** at the **[Data Systems Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/)**.

My research area is the application of LLMs in Data Management Systems.

In my free time, I enjoy socializing and engaging in conversations with people to learn new perspectives. I love playing badminton, traveling, watching movies, and reading novels.
